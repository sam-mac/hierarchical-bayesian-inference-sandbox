# Basic Rules

* Don't use `from __future__ import annotations` at the beginning of python files, this isn't necessary since we're using python 3.13...
* Ensure code uses proper type hinting.
* Write unit tests where necessary, and ensure all tests work before finalising tasks
* Don't remove text in the .gitignore file that isn't related to nor blocking you from providing solutions or code updates. Don't remove text in .gitignore unless you're explicitly asked to do so. If text in .gitignore files are blocking you from providing code updates, first get confirmed explicit approval from me.
* Explain your reasoning for your solutions and code updates.
